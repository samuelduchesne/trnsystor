    The EQUATIONS statement allows variables to be defined as algebraic
    functions of constants, previously defined variables, and outputs from
    TRNSYS components. These variables can then be used in place of numbers in
    the TRNSYS input file to represent inputs to components; numerical values of
    parameters; and initial values of inputs and time-dependent variables. The
    capabilities of the EQUATIONS statement overlap but greatly exceed those of
    the CONSTANTS statement described in the previous section.

    Hint:
        In trnsystor, the Equation class works hand in hand with the
        :class:`EquationCollection` class. This class behaves a little bit like
        the equation component in the TRNSYS Studio, meaning that you can list
        equation in a block, give it a name, etc. See the
        :class:`EquationCollection` class for more details.

        Crate an equation with a combination of a generic expression (with
        placeholder variables) and a list of arguments. The underlying engine
        will use Sympy and symbolic variables. You can use a mixture of
        :class:`TypeVariable` and :class:`Equation`, :class:`Constant` as
        well as the python default :class:`str`.

        .. Important::

            If a `str` is passed in place of an expression argument (
            :attr:`args`), make sure to declare that string as an Equation or
            a Constant later in the routine.

        Examples:
            In this example, we define a variable (var_a) and we want it to be
            equal to the 'Outlet Air Humidity Ratio' divided by 12 + log(
            Temperature to heat source). In a TRNSYS deck file one would have to
            manually determine the unit numbers and output numbers and write
            something like : '[1, 2]/12 + log([1, 1])'. With the
            :func:`~from_symbolic_expression`, we can do this very simply:

            1. first, define the name of the variable:

            >>> name = "var_a"

            2. then, define the expression as a string. Here, the variables `a`
            and `b` are symbols that represent the two type outputs. Note that
            their name has bee chosen arbitrarily.

            >>> exp = "log(a) + b / 12"
            >>> # would be also equivalent to
            >>> exp = "log(x) + y / 12"

            3. here, we define the actual variables (the type outputs) after
            loading our model from its proforma:

            >>> from trnsystor import TrnsysModel
            >>> fan = TrnsysModel.from_xml("fan_type.xml")
            >>> vars = (fan.outputs[0], fan.outputs[1])

            .. Important::

                The order of the symbolic variable encountered in the string
                expression (step 2), from left to right, must be the same for
                the tuple of variables. For instance, `a` is followed by `b`,
                therefore `fan.outputs[0]` is followed by `fan.outputs[1]`.

            4. finally, we create the Equation. Note that vars is passed with
            the '*' declaration to unpack the tuple.

            >>> from trnsystor.statement import Equation
            >>> eq = Equation.from_symbolic_expression(name, exp, *vars)
            >>> print(eq)
            [1, 1]/12 + log([1, 2])

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the variable (left-hand side), of the
                equation.
            exp (str): The expression to evaluate. Use any variable name and
                mathematical expression.
            *args (tuple): A tuple of :class:`TypeVariable` that will replace
                the any variable name specified in the above expression.
            doc (str, optional): A small description optionally printed in the
                deck file.

        Returns:
            Equation: The Equation Statement object.
