        The other simulation control statements are optional. Default values are assumed
        for TOLERANCES, LIMITS, SOLVER, EQSOLVER and DFQ if they are not present

        Args:
            version (Version): The VERSION Statement. labels the deck with the
                TRNSYS version number. See :class:`Version` for more details.
            simulation (Simulation): The SIMULATION Statement.determines the
                starting and stopping times of the simulation as well as the
                time step to be used. See :class:`Simulation` for more details.
            tolerances (Tolerances, optional): Convergence Tolerances (
                TOLERANCES). Specifies the error tolerances to be used during a
                TRNSYS simulation. See :class:`Tolerances` for more details.
            limits (Limits, optional): The LIMITS Statement. Sets limits on the
                number of iterations that will be performed by TRNSYS during a
                time step before it is determined that the differential
                equations and/or algebraic equations are not converging. See
                :class:`Limits` for more details.
            nancheck (NaNCheck, optional): The NAN_CHECK Statement. An optional
                debugging feature in TRNSYS. If the NAN_CHECK statement is
                present, then the TRNSYS kernel checks every output of each
                component at each iteration and generates a clean error if ever
                one of those outputs has been set to the FORTRAN NaN condition.
                See :class:`NaNCheck` for more details.
            overwritecheck (OverwriteCheck, optional): The OVERWRITE_CHECK
                Statement. An optional debugging feature in TRNSYS. Checks to
                make sure that each Type did not write outside its allotted
                space. See :class:`OverwriteCheck` for more details.
            timereport (TimeReport, optional): The TIME_REPORT Statement. Turns
                on or off the internal calculation of the time spent on each
                unit. See :class:`TimeReport` for more details.
            dfq (DFQ, optional): Allows the user to select one of three
                algorithms built into TRNSYS to numerically solve differential
                equations. See :class:`DFQ` for more details.
            width (Width, optional): Set the number of characters to be allowed
                on a line of TRNSYS output. See :class:`Width` for more details.
            nocheck (NoCheck, optional): The Convergence Check Suppression
                Statement. Remove up to 20 inputs for the convergence check. See
                :class:`NoCheck` for more details.
            eqsolver (EqSolver, optional): The Equation Solving Method
                Statement. The order in which blocks of EQUATIONS are solved is
                controlled by the EQSOLVER Statement. See :class:`EqSolver` for
                more details.
            solver (Solver, optional): The SOLVER Statement. Select the
                computational scheme. See :class:`Solver` for more details.
            nolist (NoList, optional): The NOLIST Statement. See :class:`NoList`
                for more details.
            list (List, optional): The LIST Statement. See :class:`List` for
                more details.
            map (Map, optional): The MAP Statement. See :class:`Map` for more
                details.

        Note:
            Some Statements have not been implemented because only TRNSYS gods ðŸ˜‡
