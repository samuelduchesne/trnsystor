# trnsystor

A python scripting language for TRNSYS.

Create .dck files from stratch in an object-oriented python structure. Add components,
specify parameters, connect components together and more throught python code.

## Installation

```cmd
pip install trnsystor
```

## Usage

Since TRNSYS 18, type proformas can be exported to XML schemas. *trnsystor* builds on this
easy to read data structure to easily create TrnsysModels using the most popular scripting
language in the data science community:
[Python](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language).

From the xml file of a type proforma, simply create a TrnsysModel object by invoking the
`from_xml()` constructor:

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor import TrnsysModel
>>> xml = "tests/input_files/Type951.xml"
>>> pipe1 = TrnsysModel.from_xml(xml)
```

Calling `pipe1` will display its Type number and Name:

```pydocstring
>>> pipe1
Type951: Ecoflex 2-Pipe: Buried Piping System
```

Then, `pipe1` can be used to **get** and **set** attributes such as inputs, outputs,
parameters and external files. For example, to set the *Number of Fluid Nodes*, simply set
the new value as you would change a dict value:

```pydocstring
>>> pipe1.parameters['Number_of_Fluid_Nodes'] = 50
>>> pipe1.parameters['Number_of_Fluid_Nodes']
NNumber of Fluid Nodes; units=-; value=50
The number of nodes into which each pipe will be divided. Increasing the number of nodes will improve the accuracy but cost simulation run-time.
```

Since the *Number of Fluid Nodes* is a cycle parameter, the number of outputs is modified
dynamically:

calling [pipe1.outputs` should display 116 Outputs.

The new outputs are now accessible and can also be accessed with loops:

```pydocstring
>>> for i in range(1,50):
...    print(pipe1.outputs["Average_Fluid_Temperature_Pipe_1_{}".format(i)])
Average Fluid Temperature - Pipe 1-1; units=C; value=0.0 celsius
The average temperature of the fluid in the specified node of the first buried pipe.
... *skipping redundant lines*
Average Fluid Temperature - Pipe 1-49; units=C; value=0.0 celsius
The average temperature of the fluid in the specified node of the first buried pipe.
```

## Connecting outputs with inputs

Connecting model outputs to other model inputs is quite straightforward and uses a simple
mapping technique. For example, to map the first two ouputs of `pipe1`to the first two
inputs of `pipe2`, we create a mapping of the form `mapping = {0:0, 1:1}`. In other words,
this means that the output 0 of pipe1 is connected to the input 1 of pipe2 and the output
1 of pipe1 is connected to the output 1 of pipe2. Keep in mind that since python
traditionally uses 0-based indexing, it has been decided that the same logic in this
package even though TRNSYS uses 1-based indexing. The package will internally assign the
1-based index automatically when saving to file.

For convenience, the mapping can also be done using the output/input names such as
`mapping = {'Outlet_Air_Temperature': 'Inlet_Air_Temperature',
'Outlet_Air_Humidity_Ratio': 'Inlet_Air_Humidity_Ratio'}`:

```pydocstring
# First let's create a second pipe, by copying the first one:
pipe2 = pipe1.copy()
# Then, connect pipe1 to pipe2:
pipe1.connect_to(pipe2, mapping={0:0, 1:1})
```

## Equations

In the TRNSYS studio, equations are components holding a list of user-defined expressions.
In trnsystor a similar approach has been taken: the `Equation` class handles the creation
of equations and the [EquationCollection` class handles the block of equations. Here's an
example:

First, create a series of Equation by invoking the [from_expression` constructor. This
allows you to input the equation as a string.

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor import Equation
>>> equa1 = Equation.from_expression("TdbAmb = [011,001]")
>>> equa2 = Equation.from_expression("rhAmb = [011,007]")
>>> equa3 = Equation.from_expression("Tsky = [011,004]")
>>> equa4 = Equation.from_expression("vWind = [011,008]")
```

One can create a equation block:

```pydocstring
>>> equa_col_1 = EquationCollection([equa1, equa2, equa3, equa4], name='test')
```

## Changing Initial Input Values

To change the initial value of an input, simply call it by name or with it's zero-based
index and set a new value. This new value will be checked against the bounds set by the
proforma as for a regular input or parameter.

```pydocstring
>>> pipe1.parameters['Number_of_Fluid_Nodes'] = 50
>>> pipe_type.initial_input_values["Inlet_Fluid_Temperature_Pipe_1"] = 70
>>> pipe_type.initial_input_values["Inlet_Fluid_Temperature_Pipe_1"].default  # or, pipe_type.initial_input_values[0]
70.0 <Unit('degC')>
```

## Creating a Deck file

A deck file (.dck) is created by instanciating a `Deck` object and calling the instance
method `.save()`. The Deck object contains the Simulation Cards and the different models
(components) for the project. The following code block shows one way of creating a Deck
and saving it to file.

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor import Deck, ControlCards
>>> 
>>> control_card = ControlCards.debug_template(). # Specifies a predefined set of control cards. See section bellow.
>>> cdeck = Deck(name="mydeck", control_cards=control_card, author="jovyan")
>>> 
>>> list_models = []  # a list of TrnsysModel objects created earlier
>>>  
>>> deck.update_models(list_models)
>>> 
>>> deck.save("my_project.dck")
```

### Simulation Cards

The Simulation Cards is a chuck of code that informs TRNSYS of various simulation controls
such as start time end time and time-step. trnsystor implements many of those *Statements*
with a series of Statement objects.

For instance, to create simulation cards using default values, simply call the `all()`
constructor:

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor import ControlCards
>>> cc = ControlCards.all()
>>> print(cc)
*** Control Cards
SOLVER 0 1 1          ! Solver statement    Minimum relaxation factor   Maximum relaxation factor
MAP                   ! MAP statement
NOLIST                ! NOLIST statement
NOCHECK 0             ! CHECK Statement
DFQ 1                 ! TRNSYS numerical integration solver method
SIMULATION 0 8760 1   ! Start time  End time    Time step
TOLERANCES 0.01 0.01  ! Integration Convergence
LIMITS 25 10 25       ! Max iterations  Max warnings    Trace limit
EQSOLVER 0            ! EQUATION SOLVER statement
```

### Selecting elements of components

Inputs, Outputs, Parameters, Derivatives, SpecialCards and ExternalFiles can be accessed
via their attribute in any TrnsysModel component. They are accessed via their position as
for in a list. It is also possible to `slice` the collection to retrieved more than one
element. In this case a list is returned:

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor.trnsysmodel import TrnsysModel
>>> pipe = TrnsysModel.from_xml("tests/input_files/Type951.xml")
>>> pipe.inputs[0:2]  # getting the first 2 inputs
[Inlet Fluid Temperature - Pipe 1; units=C; value=15.0 Â°C
The temperature of the fluid flowing into the first buried horizontal pipe., Inlet Fluid Flowrate - Pipe 1; units=(kg)/(hr); value=0.0 kg/hr
The flowrate of fluid into the first buried horizontal pipe.]
```

## Parsing string snippets

Since version 1.4, it is possible to parse string snippets of TRNSYS components.
Deck.load() and Deck.loads() (similarly to json.load and json.loads for users who are
familiar with json deserializing in python).

For example, one can load the following string into a Deck object:

```pythonstub
from trnsystor import Deck
s = r"""
UNIT 3 TYPE  11 Tee Piece
*$UNIT_NAME Tee Piece
*$MODEL district\xmltypes\Type11h.xml
*$POSITION 50.0 50.0
*$LAYER Main
PARAMETERS 1
1  ! 1 Tee piece mode
INPUTS 4
0,0  ! [unconnected] Tee Piece:Temperature at inlet 1
flowRateDoubled  ! double:flowRateDoubled -> Tee Piece:Flow rate at inlet 1
0,0  ! [unconnected] Tee Piece:Temperature at inlet 2
0,0  ! [unconnected] Tee Piece:Flow rate at inlet 2
*** INITIAL INPUT VALUES
20   ! Temperature at inlet 1
100  ! Flow rate at inlet 1
20   ! Temperature at inlet 2
100  ! Flow rate at inlet 2

* EQUATIONS "double"
*
EQUATIONS 1
flowRateDoubled  =  2*[1, 2]
*$UNIT_NAME double
*$LAYER Main
*$POSITION 50.0 50.0
*$UNIT_NUMBER 2
"""
dck = Deck.loads(s, proforma_root="tests/input_files")
```

If the same string was in a file, it could be as easily parsed using Deck.load():

```pydocstring
>>> from trnsystor import Deck
>>> with open("file.txt", "r") as fp:
>>>     dck = Deck.load(fp, proforma_root="tests/input_files")
```
